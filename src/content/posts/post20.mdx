# Essential C++ Data Structures for Competitive Programming

## What is C++ STL?

A standout feature of C++ is the Standard Template Library (STL), setting it apart from other programming languages.
STL offers a collection of pre-defined templates, including containers, algorithms, and iterators, simplifying the
implementation of various data structures without writing everything from scratch.

## Containers and Functions in C++ STL

### 1. unordered_set

An unordered_set is a container that stores unique elements in no particular order. It allows fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value. Common functions include:

- `insert(value)`: Adds an element to the set.
- `find(value)`: Searches for an element and returns an iterator to it if found, otherwise returns the end iterator.
- `erase(value)`: Removes an element from the set.

### 2. vector

A vector is a dynamic array that can resize itself automatically when an element is added or removed.
It provides random access to elements. Common functions include:

- `push_back(value)`: Adds an element to the end of the vector.
- `pop_back()`: Removes the last element of the vector.
- `at(index)`: Returns a reference to the element at the specified position.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the vector.

### 3. set

A set is a container that stores unique elements in a specific order. Elements are automatically sorted. Common functions include:

- `insert(value)`: Adds an element to the set.
- `find(value)`: Searches for an element and returns an iterator to it if found.
- `erase(value)`: Removes an element from the set.

### 4. unordered_multiset

An unordered_multiset is similar to an unordered_set, but it allows duplicate elements.
Common functions include:

- `insert(value)`: Adds an element to the multiset.
- `count(value)`: Returns the number of occurrences of an element.
- `erase(value)`: Removes all occurrences of an element.

### 5. multiset

A multiset is like a set, but it allows duplicate elements, and they are stored in a sorted order. Common functions include:

- `insert(value)`: Adds an element to the multiset.
- `count(value)`: Returns the number of occurrences of an element.
- `erase(value)`: Removes all occurrences of an element.

### 6. unordered_map

An unordered_map is a key-value pair container where keys are unique, but the order of elements is not maintained.
Common functions include:

- `insert({key, value})`: Adds a key-value pair to the map.
- `find(key)`: Searches for an element by its key and returns an iterator to it if found.
- `erase(key)`: Removes the element associated with the given key.
- `operator[key]`: Accesses the value associated with the given key, inserting a new key-value pair if it doesn't exist.

### 7. map

A map is an associative container that stores elements in key-value pairs with unique keys. Elements are stored in sorted order based on the key. Common functions include:

- `insert({key, value})`: Adds a key-value pair to the map.
- `find(key)`: Searches for an element by its key and returns an iterator to it if found.
- `erase(key)`: Removes the element associated with the given key.
- `operator[key]`: Accesses the value associated with the given key, inserting a new key-value pair if it doesn't exist.

### 8. unordered_multimap

An unordered_multimap is similar to an unordered_map, but it allows multiple pairs with the same key.
Common functions include:

- `insert({key, value})`: Adds a key-value pair to the multimap.
- `equal_range(key)`: Returns a range of elements with the same key.
- `erase(key)`: Removes all elements associated with the given key.

### 9. queue

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that allows insertion at the back and removal from the front.
Common functions include:

- `push(value)`: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
- `pop()`: Removes the front element of the queue.
- `front()`: Returns a reference to the front element.
- `back()`: Returns a reference to the back element.

### 10. stack

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows insertion and removal of elements at the top of the stack.
Common functions include:

- `push(value)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes the top element of the stack.
- `top()`: Returns a reference to the top element.

### 11. deque

A deque (double-ended queue) is a container that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the back.
Common functions include:

- `push_back(value)`: Adds an element to the back of the deque.
- `push_front(value)`: Adds an element to the front of the deque.
- `pop_back()`: Removes the last element of the deque.
- `pop_front()`: Removes the first element of the deque.

### 12. priority_queue

A priority_queue is a type of queue where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority, regardless of their order in the queue.
Common functions include:

- `push(value)`: Adds an element to the queue based on its priority.
- `pop()`: Removes the element with the highest priority.
- `top()`: Returns a reference to the element with the highest priority.

### 13. multimap

A multimap is similar to a map, but it allows multiple values for the same key. Elements are stored in sorted order based on the key. Common functions include:

- `insert({key, value})`: Adds a key-value pair to the multimap.
- `equal_range(key)`: Returns a range of elements with the same key.
- `erase(key)`: Removes all elements associated with the given key.
