# Coding Mastery: Beyond Rendering - A New Milestone in Game Development Education

## Announcing the Release of "Coding Mastery- Beyond Rendering"

We are thrilled to announce the release of "Coding Mastery: Beyond Rendering", the latest addition to the acclaimed Coding Mastery series. This new volume marks a significant milestone, completing the pentagon of knowledge that the series offers to aspiring and experienced programmers alike.

### The Coding Mastery Series: A Commitment to Learning

The Coding Mastery series is designed to immerse readers in the exciting world of coding and artificial intelligence. Covering a wide range of topics from inventing interpreted languages to leveraging AI-driven solutions, each book provides practical learning experiences for both seasoned developers and coding novices.

### Beyond Rendering: From Theory to Practice

"Coding Mastery: Beyond Rendering" builds upon the theoretical foundation laid in its predecessor, "Coding Mastery: Rendering Realities". While the previous book explored the science and algorithms behind visual representation in computer graphics, this new volume takes a hands-on approach, guiding readers through the practical aspects of building a rendering engine from the ground up.

#### What to Expect:

- **Engine Building:** Step-by-step instructions for creating your own rendering engine, using the "RenderingEngine" repository as a foundation.
- **Geometric Rendering:** Detailed tutorials on rendering various shapes, including lines, cubes, and spheres.
- **Lighting and Cameras:** Techniques for implementing lighting in 3D space and creating free camera movement for an immersive experience.

### The Complete Coding Mastery Collection

With the release of "Beyond Rendering", the Coding Mastery series now consists of five comprehensive volumes:

1. **Coding Mastery: Beyond Rendering** - A practical guide to building rendering engines and creating dynamic virtual worlds.
2. **Coding Mastery: Rendering Realities** - An exploration of the theoretical aspects of computer graphics and game development.
3. **Coding Mastery: How to Code any Feature?** - A practical guide to mastering coding, escaping tutorial hell, and harnessing AI in development.
4. **Coding Mastery: The Power of LLMs in Dynamic Knowledgebases** - An in-depth look at integrating Large Language Models with knowledge graphs.
5. **Coding Mastery: Building Interpreted Languages** - A technical reference for creating interpreted programming languages.
