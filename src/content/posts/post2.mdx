# My Hall of Fame Journey at Hacktoberfest 2023

I am overjoyed to share that I have earned a spot in the Hall of Fame at Hacktoberfest! This achievement is a testament to the incredible journey I've had as part of this vibrant and supportive community. Participating in Hacktoberfest 2023 has been both an honor and a privilege, allowing me to grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to open-source projects.

## My Contributions

During Hacktoberfest 2023, I was actively involved as both a Contributor and a Maintainer. My primary focus was on two of my most recent repositories:

- [Coda (code) - A Programming Language written in C++](https://lnkd.in/gmQw4xZJ)
- [CodaWiki (low-code) - Wiki for the project Coda](https://lnkd.in/geqTs9nG)

Working on these projects was an enriching experience. Coda, a programming language written in C++, challenged my coding skills and pushed me to explore new depths of programming concepts. CodaWiki, the low-code wiki for the Coda project, allowed me to focus on documentation and user engagement, ensuring that the project is accessible and useful for a broader audience.

## My Milestone

I am delighted to announce that I am among the first 50,000 contributors to successfully merge a Pull Request (PR) during Hacktoberfest 2023. This milestone is particularly special as it has led to a tree being planted in my name, symbolizing my contribution to both the coding community and the environment. You can view my certificate [here](https://lnkd.in/gBRcegir).

## Join Me

But the excitement doesn't stop here! Hacktoberfest is still ongoing, and there is ample time for you to join this global open-source celebration. Until October 31st, developers of all skill levels have the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects, learn from each other, and make a tangible impact on the community.

By contributing to my repositories, you can not only enhance your skills but also be part of something bigger. Let's work together to create meaningful projects and strengthen the open-source community.

Participating in Hacktoberfest has been a rewarding experience, and I am grateful for the support and camaraderie of the community. It is a reminder of the power of collaboration and the impact we can make when we come together with a shared goal. I look forward to continuing this journey, contributing to open-source projects, and celebrating many more milestones with all of you.
