# Receiving the 'सन्मान चिन्ह'

## Honored to Receive the Trophy from रंजन क्रीडा मंडळ

I am honored and humbled to receive the "सन्मान चिन्ह" (trophy) from रंजन क्रीडा मंडळ at the गुणगौरव समारंभ. Reflecting on my journey and the motivations behind my books, this recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication invested in providing valuable coding resources.

### Interview Reflections

During my interview, I reflected on my journey and the reasons behind writing my books. I was driven by the challenges I faced while sifting through the internet for reliable coding resources. I wanted to create something that would spare others the same struggle, providing them with comprehensive guides.

### Inspiration

When asked about my inspiration, I shared how coding is more than just a skill for me; it's a form of self-expression, almost like an art. A thought that I deeply resonate with is: "ज्ञानाची भूक असली तर कुठलाही पराक्रम करू शकतात" (Translation: "If you have a hunger for knowledge, you can achieve any feat").

### Gratitude

Thank you to everyone who has supported me along this journey. This recognition is a great encouragement to continue my passion for coding and sharing knowledge.
