# From Planning to Execution - A Deep Dive into Coding Game Features

## A Comprehensive Guide to Structured Development and Flexible Implementation

This blog post is based on my book "How to code any feature", which provides in-depth guidance on tackling various programming challenges. Today, we'll explore the process of coding game features, using a weapon system for an online first-person shooter as our example.

### The Importance of Planning

Before diving into coding, it's crucial to plan your feature thoroughly. Let's break down our weapon system into its core components:

#### Weapon Properties and Classes

- Weapon properties: damage, range, ammo, reload time
- Weapon classes: sniper rifles, submachine guns, etc.

#### Pickup Mechanics

- Implement a system where pressing 'E' allows players to pick up weapons within a 2-meter radius. This involves:

1. Calculating distance between player and weapon
2. Removing the weapon from the world
3. Adding the weapon to the player's inventory

#### Weapon Switching

- Use a List data structure to store the player's weapons, allowing for easy scrolling through the inventory.

#### Shooting Mechanics

- Implement a raycast system to detect hits and call a <em>takeDamage</em> function on the hit player.

#### Dropping Weapons

- Allow players to drop weapons, either automatically when empty or manually with a key press.

### Implementing the Weapon System

Once the planning is complete, start with pseudo-code to outline classes, methods, and attributes. Begin with the most fundamental elements (like the Gun class) and progressively build up to more complex systems.

### Best Practices

#### Test Frequently During Development

- Regularly review and improve your methods

#### Break Down Tasks into Manageable Subtasks

- Collaborate effectively by distributing subtasks

#### Balance Between Structured Planning and Flexible Implementation

- Balance between structured planning and flexible implementation

### Adapting Your Approach

While thorough planning is crucial for complex features, experienced developers may sometimes dive directly into coding for simpler tasks. However, it's important to:

#### Regularly Review and Improve Your Methods

- Understand when a more structured approach is necessary

#### Gradually Build Expertise to Find the Right Balance

- Gradually build expertise to find the right balance between fluidity and methodology

<em>
  Remember, the key to successful feature implementation lies in finding the
  right balance between thorough planning and adaptable execution. As you gain
  experience, you'll develop the intuition to know when to plan extensively and
  when to code more fluidly.
