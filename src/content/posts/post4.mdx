# My First Book, Coding Mastery: Building Programming Languages

I'm thrilled to share that my latest endeavor, "Coding Mastery: Building Programming Languages," has been out in the wild for about a month and a half now!

### A Technical Reference

This technical reference delves into the intricate world of programming languages, covering topics like interpretation, lexing, and parsing. Tailored for those with programming experience and a basic understanding of C++ fundamentals, it's a comprehensive guide suitable for both coding veterans and newcomers.

### Book Organization

Organized into 15 chapters, the journey begins with an exploration of computer communication and the rich history of programming languages. From grammar to functions, each chapter unfolds key aspects with clarity, examples, and practical tasks at the end for skill reinforcement.

### Gratitude

A special shoutout of gratitude to [Codepulse](https://lnkd.in/gCbeHcnT) and [tylerlaceby](https://lnkd.in/g6-rgq5J) for their support and inspiration during the creation of this project!

### Personal Note

On a personal note, I'm excited to share that amidst the challenges, I successfully birthed my very own programming language, Coda! Check it out on [GitHub](https://lnkd.in/gyaU73mT).

### The Journey

While the journey took around 3 attempts spanning over a few years, with the last one taking 4 months, it's been an incredible learning experience. The book is available for download on [Amazon](https://a.co/d/1fkELt0).

### Spread the Word!

Let's spread the word! Share, discuss, and if you've had the chance to explore the book, I'd love to hear your thoughts and reviews.

### Thank You!

Thank you for being a part of this journey! Here's to coding mastery and building programming languages!
