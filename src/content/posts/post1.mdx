# Challenges of Web Development Evolution

**The Never-Ending Cycle of Frameworks**

Every week, there's a new framework or an update to an existing one, making the web development landscape increasingly cluttered. The rapid pace of change and the constant stream of new technologies can make it feel like the web is becoming a garbage heap of fleeting trends and disposable tools.

**Questioning the Need for Visual Complexity**

Frameworks are touted as essential for speeding up development and creating visually appealing sites. But do we really need everything to be visually stunning? I don't think so. A decent website built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can do the job just fine.

**Experience with Next.js**

Take, for example, my experience with Next.js. I built a website using Next.js 13, and the very next day, Next.js 14 was released, instantly making my code legacy. It was a frustrating reminder of the relentless pace of change in web development.

**Simplifying Solutions**

On that website, I added a guestbook section. Do I really need a database for that? No, I don't. Simple solutions often suffice and can be more sustainable in the long run.

**Embracing Simplicity**

This blog site is my attempt to provide valuable information without relying on overcomplicated, rapidly outdated technologies. It's built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate that effective, helpful content doesn't need the latest and greatest frameworks. It's time to step back from the enshitification of the web and appreciate the beauty of simplicity.
