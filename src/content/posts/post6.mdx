# Winning the LLM & Diffusion Category at the Buildathon
## Our Team, Entropy, Emerged Victorious at the Buildathon!

I am thrilled to announce that our team, Entropy, won the LLM & Diffusion category at the latest Buildathon! This event, hosted by YourStory Media and Ola Krutrim in collaboration with 100xEngineers, drew over 200 participants from more than 50 teams. The Cleo Project won the First Prize in the LLM and Diffusion Category.

### The Award Ceremony

The award ceremony took place at DevSparks 24, where Varun Mayya, CEO of Aeos and a recognized IT industry leader, presented us with our prizes. It was an honor to receive the award from him in front of such a large audience. We were given the opportunity to present our project in front of over 1000 techies.

### Meeting the IT Powerhouses

During DevSparks 24, we met Sridev Ramesh, CEO of 100xEngineers, and Siddhant Goswami, CTO of 100xEngineers. Meeting these IT powerhouses was an incredible experience, and their encouragement drove our success. Thank you to the organizers and all of the participants for making the Buildathon and DevSparks 24 a wonderful experience.
